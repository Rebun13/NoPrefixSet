# NoPrefixSet

## Description

There is a given list of strings where each string contains only lowercase letters from _a - j_, inclusive. The set of strings is said to be a **GOOD SET** if no string is a prefix of another string. In this case, print **GOOD SET**. Otherwise, print **BAD SET** on the first line followed by the string being checked.

Note: If two strings are identical, they are prefixes of each other.

## Prints

- string(s): either **GOOD SET** or **BAD SET** on one line followed by the word on the next line. No return value is expected.

## Input

- First line contains _n_, the size of _words[]_.
- Then next _n_ lines each contain a string, _words[i]_.
